# PKD Project - Image app thing ðŸ¤¯

Using [Gloss Library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) to generate faces based on user input.

## Installation

### Pre-compiled binary

Download the binary from the releases page and run it from a terminal, nothing else should be required! (Except maybe some OpenGL dependencies)

### Building from source

#### Linux

Install the OpenGL dependencies 
``` 
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```

Install Gloss library
```
cabal update
cabal install gloss
```

Compile the cli.hs file and run it.

#### Windows

If you're running on Windows, I would refer to [this guide!](https://linusblog.netlify.app/haskell_gloss_wsl/)

## Usage

WIP - will put screenshots and more accurate directions here once CLI is up to par.
